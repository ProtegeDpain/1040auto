Troubleshooting

Dependency Issues: If you encounter dependency conflicts, try:npm install --legacy-peer-deps

Then verify with npm audit and fix issues using npm audit fix.
Vite Errors: Ensure your vite.config.ts includes the React plugin:import { defineConfig } from 'vite';
import react from '@vitejs/plugin-react';

export default defineConfig({
  plugins: [react()],
});


Port Conflicts: If http://localhost:5173 is in use, Vite will suggest an alternative port.
ESLint Errors: Run npm run lint to identify and fix linting issues. Update .eslintrc.json if needed.
